Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was to build a system that allowed clients/students to be able to create an online account to study and prepare themselves for driving courses, such as the writen and driving tests. The client for the project was DriverPass, they wanted a system to help there local drivers learn safely and properly with feedback and direct contact with their own tutors and instructors. 

What did you do particularly well?
I was able to break down the needs of the client and make diagrams for their system.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
The one thing that I would revise in these documents would be the presentation. I feel like I rushed myself through the creation of the presentation and would make the readers nots a little more extensive and explanitory. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interprated the users needs by asking myself what I would like to see as a user in the position of using this system. It may be the most important part of designing a system to think of what the user's needs are, they are the ones that are using the system and paying for the lessons, if they have a bad experience then the system would not work as no one will be using it which makes it a failure. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approached designing this by figuring out what the client wanted and figgured out how the user would use it. The client wanted a system that is ran online that will help students learn how to drive, so we need an online program with lessons for the users. Next you have to figure out what will make the user happy when using this program, like having access to grades and feedback, or the ability to contact instructors directly from the website. These are quality of life things that are not necissary for the program to run but makes it easier for the user to use and not be turned away from the program.
